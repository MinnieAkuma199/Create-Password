# Password Generator Starter Code


## Description

The purpose of this was to create an application which an employer can use to generate a random password based on the criteria specified below. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by the JavaScript code I have written.

## Acceptance Criteria

Random password should be generated that meets certain criteria so that a STRONG password can be created to provide greater security. 

```md
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

## Lesson Learned

I was strictly manipulating a JavaScript file to produce these changes. Within JS I learned the following:
-How to call functions within functions. Building off of this, I learned how global and local variables work in practice. 
-I worked on If Else statements. I worked with Event Listeners and now have a better understanding of how JS interacts with my html doc as well as manipulates css. This occurs because the JS script is put as the last sheet for the page to load so this means it will overtake any style attributes made in css or otherwise.
-I learned how to condense within JavaScript, and how to make my code as uncomplicated as possible.
