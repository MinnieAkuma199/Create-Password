# Password Generator Starter Code


## Description

The purpose of this was to create an application which an employer can use to generate a random password based on the criteria specified below. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by the JavaScript code I have written.

WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered

WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
